# AVR-Relay
 AVR code to interface the relay and control the four electrical appliances through relay.
 
 Relays are very interesting and useful electronic component. They are a kind of switch, like those we use everyday in our home and offices to turn on and off electrical devices like bulbs, TVs, fans etc. The function of relay is to control the switching of a relatively heavier load which demands high voltages (like 240 V AC mains) or high current, from a relatively low voltage control signal (like 5v or 12v)
